Even better if you planned ahead and used\r\n    affluence as well.\r\n  * Double-rage - collect as many chests as you can and locate the exit\r\n    before-hand, then use rage, clear enemies close to the exit as quickly as\r\n    possible and go into the portal with rage still active. You can then\r\n    continue killing a few enemies on the next floor before it wears off.\r\n* Flights are not great here as they don't combine well with alteration, and\r\n  don't save you much time with rage either since the enemies are more\r\n  spread out. Flight will save more time on the earlier floors that you're\r\n  going to fight through if you need it.\r\n\r\nBe aware of the [wall traps](/wall_traps.html#potd-151-199) on these floors.\r\n"}}}
