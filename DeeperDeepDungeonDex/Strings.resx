    Microsoft ResX Schema

    Version 2.0

    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes
    associated with the data types.

    Example:

    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>

    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple
    name/value pairs.

    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture.
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the
    mimetype set.

    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:

    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can
    read any of the formats listed below.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

- Trick for Octuple Swipe:
  - Stand outside of the first spot
  - The only attack that might repeat in the same area is 4 and 5
  - If there is no repeat, follow all of the attacks - always stand where the last one hit
  - If there was a repeat, follow the attacks until the one that repeats. Wait for both hits in that area, then move into it and stay there

  - Before Onra hits 85%, position him so that he's standing on the A marker and facing south
  - When he starts casting Ancient Quaga, go behind him. This prevents an auto-attack immediately after Ancient Quaga
  - Wait for Onra to turn around and make one auto-attack. This is important for positioning Meteor Impact
  - Immediately run just past B. You need to move right after the auto to avoid a black orb AoE. You want Onra to stop on the B marker

  - Uses Black Honeymoon once at 60% health
  - Below 60% health:
    - Cold Feet
    - In Health (x2: pointblank &gt; donut OR donut &gt; pointblank)
    - Dark Harvest (x2)
    - In Health (donut) + adds
      - Summons untargetable adds outside the arena which will cast either a single circle AoE (potency 250) or four line AoEs (each potency 300), resolving shortly before In Health
      - Avoid the AoEs, then run toward Edda to dodge In Health
    - Black Honeymoon
- Stay close to avoid In Health easily
  - But be careful of the disease debuff from In Sickness in the first half of the fight
- Make sure to turn for Cold Feet

  - Giddy Bomb spawns along with several Lava Bombs as the boss starts casting Massive Burst
    - Massive Burst will do 99% max HP damage to everyone if it finishes
    - Giddy Bomb does a pointblank AoE that can interrupt the boss's Massive Burst. It can be moved around by attacking it
    - Lava Bombs are the same as before, and can get in the way of your attempts to move the Giddy Bomb if you're not prepared
- Grey and Giddy Bomb spawn locations are static. Locations below are relative to the center and listed per rotation (Grey &gt; Grey &gt; Giddy)

  - phase 2: uses Abyss and Shackle until HP reaches 65%
  - Summon Darkness: spawns 1 Bicephalic Corse and 1 Iron Corse

  - Summon Darkness: spawns 1 Iron, 1 Giant, and 1 Bicephalic Corse
  - phase 4: rotation of Doom &gt; Abyss &gt; Word of Pain &gt; Shackle &gt; Abyss &gt; Word of Pain
- Lust can be used to AoE the adds down quickly (3 hits) while also applying vulnerability stacks to the boss
- Adds remain on the battlefield when killed, and will be resurrected after a while if not cleared with resolution
- Resolution can be used to kill adds in one shot. It can also be used on the corpses to remove them from the battle, preventing them from resurrecting
- You'll want to use at least one resolution to clear most, if not all, of the adds. They are likely to overwhelm you otherwise

- Full rotation takes 56 seconds
- Kill adds quickly, or they will use Final Sting, which does 70% max HP damage (each). This can be outranged, but the adds will keep using it repeatedly until it hits or they die
- If you use lust during the second Rotten Stench cast, it will last long enough to kill 2 sets of adds. Steel may be needed to survive long enough on non-tanks though
- Rotten Stench will one-shot a DPS or healer without steel

  - Summon Darkness (Gargoyle): calls an untargetable gargoyle that will use a large telegraphed line AoE at the same time as Dark Mist
  - Dark Mist
  - Summon Darkness (Zombies): calls 4 zombie adds that will slowly crawl towards you. If one touches you, you will be bound until it dies
  - Void Fire IV
  - Void Aero
  - Summon Darkness (Vodoriga): calls an untargetable vodoriga that will use a telegraphed circle AoE just after the next Void Fire IV
  - Void Fire IV
  - Dark Mist
  - Summon Darkness (Succubus): calls a succubus add - in addition to autoattacks, uses Sweet Steel and Void Fire II
  - Void Aero
  - Void Fire IV
  - Fatal Allure
  - Blood Sword - the HP drain is 1:1, so whether you DPS the add or the boss doesn't matter in terms of damage
  - Blood Rain - kills any remaining zombies
- Entire rotation is about 1m50s
- Don't let the zombies catch you
- Physical ranged jobs can just kite the zombies until they despawn. It's likely better for others to kill them. They have pretty low HP
- If you're not killing the succubus add, it's worth putting DoTs on it anyway
- In party play, Summon Darkness (Gargoyle/Vodoriga) summons one add for each party member

  - Drench
  - Electrogenesis
  - Douse
  - Fang's End
- Hit Sprint when it uses Drench if you're still heavied to escape Electrogenesis safely. Only needed 1 out of every 5 times because of diminshing returns on the heavy (15s &gt; 7s &gt; 3s &gt; resist &gt; resist &gt; 15s)
- If you're kiting, it is a good idea to try to pull the boss to the same place every time for Douse. If they're all stacked in one place, it's much easier to keep the boss out of them, reducing damage taken
- If not kiting, simply pull him out of the puddle after Douse

  - Charybdis (x2)
  - Thunderbolt
  - Charybdis
  - Trounce again, but from the north end
- Enters enrage mode at 15% - stands up and casts Ecliptic Meteor, dealing 80% max HP damage to everyone in the party. Continues to cast this over and over until the fight ends
- If you are standing in front of him during meteors, he can also autoattack you (so don't do that!)
- Most jobs require a very strict strategy to get through this final push. See the job-specific notes below
- Useful macros:
  - Cancel Lust: /statusoff "Transfiguration"
    - Useful if you have trouble clicking it off quickly
  - Cancel food: /statusoff "Well Fed"
    - Again useful if you have trouble cancelling it quickly otherwise
    - Cancelling food is useful during enrage if you're healing through it because Meteors do damage based on your max HP. Lower max HP means less damage taken, which means less damage to heal
    - Cancelling your food when not at full HP also acts like a pseudo heal since it lowers your max HP, which actually raises your current HP%
  - Check boss HP% with decimal place: /echo &amp;lt;thpp&amp;gt;
    - useful so you can get him as close to 15.0% as possible without accidentally starting the burst phase

    <value>- Rotation:
  - Scalding Scolding
  - Remedy Bomb (blue) spawns along with several untargetable Giddy Bombs
    - Remedy Bomb starts using Hypothermal Combustion immediately with a long cast time. It must be killed before this goes off to prevent massive roomwide damage (80% max HP damage + 5s deep freeze)
    - Giddy Bombs all use Hypothermal Combustion after a few seconds. Theirs is a small telegraphed pointblank AoE with a short cast time, so stay away from them
  - Sap (x3)
  - Scalding Scolding
  - Sap
  - Lava Bomb (red) spawns along with several Giddy Bombs as the boss starts casting Massive Burst.
    - Massive Burst will do 99% max HP damage to everyone if it finishes
    - Lava Bomb does a pointblank AoE that can interrupt the boss's Massive Burst. It can be moved around by attacking it
    - Giddy Bombs are the same as before, and can get in the way of your attempts to move the Lava Bomb if you're not prepared
- Full rotation takes 1 minute, 20 seconds
- Remedy Bomb and Lava Bomb spawn locations are static. Knowing the spawn locations of Lava Bombs is especially useful, as you can then pull the boss to where it will spawn, allowing you to to keep uptime on the boss instead of running around to position the bomb
- DO NOT open with lust if soloing, as the cleave at the start will destroy you
- The safest time to use lust is during the triple Sap cast. Kill the Remedy Bomb as quickly as possible to maximize your time. DO NOT get greedy here. Drop transfiguration immediately regardless of stacks after the third Sap, as you need to be prepared for the cleave that follows
- Another option is to use Lust to kill the Lava Bomb and get stacks on the boss at the same time. It will take 4 hits to kill the Lava Bomb, so don't delay
