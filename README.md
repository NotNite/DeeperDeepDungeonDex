# DeeperDeepDungeonDex

Rewrite of DeepDungeonDex.

## Why?

Spite.

## TODO

- [ ] Parse the already existing Deep Dungeon spreadsheets instead of the YAML submodule bullshit
  - This information is wrong and buggy - best to use the existing data the community's made
- [x] Show basic mob information
- [ ] Show basic floor information
- [ ] Show The Strat:tm:
